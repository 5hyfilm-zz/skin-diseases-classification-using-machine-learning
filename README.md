# JSTP #22 Skin Disease Classification Using Machine Learning

This was JSTP #22 project about using machine learning to classify most skin disease in Thailand but I get only these skin disease which are

1. Atopic Dermatitis [ad]
2. Normal [nm]
3. Psoriasis [ps]
4. Seborrhoeic Keratosis [sk]

Train CNN model by using [HAM10000](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T)and transfer weights to [PJ6103](https://github.com/EvilPickle-PCSHSPT/PJ61403_DATA)

Some line of code are wrong because I changed some filenames and I did not update those filenames, so if you want to run code you need to update some line of code
